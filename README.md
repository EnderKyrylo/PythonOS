# PythonOS
PythonOS is a wrapper for all OSes for easy to use CLI interface.

Example commands:
lsd = Lists the files and folders in this directory.
cdir = Changes the working directory (examples: cdir /Documents or cdir .. to go back).
viewfile [file] = Views the text or code file.
open-win = Opens a blank window.
clear = Clears the terminal.
shutdown = Stops PythonOS.
mfold [name] = Creates a folder.
mfile [name] = Creates a text file.

Requirements:
Tkinter module,
Any operating system,
OS module,
Platform module,
Shutils module.

How to start:
Type "python3 /Path/To/PythonOS.py" in terminal then press enter.

Future updates (planned):
Basic applications,
Full GUI.

I suggest you put the code in a folder specifically for PythonOS.
